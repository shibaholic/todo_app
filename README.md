# todo_app

The Todo App project is a web application that allows users to improve their daily productivity by letting them create a fun and interactive todo list.

## Tech stack

The project consists of a frontend user interface, backend API and database. 

- The frontend uses React.js and TypeScript.  
- The backend uses C# ASP.NET. 
- The database uses MS SQL Server.

## Deployment

- The frontend will be hosted as a published GitHub page. 
- The backend will be dockerized and hosted as an Web App Service on Azure.
- The database will be hosted on Azure as an Azure SQL Server instance.
